# graphene-sample-data
This repo contains the sample attack graph generated by Graphene.

## Overview
The `all_layer_samples.json` file contains detailed information the sample attack graph. Each entry represents one node (i.e., one CVE), including descriptions, scores, conditions, and entities associated with the vulnerability. The similarity scores are used to construct edges among nodes.

## File Structure

The JSON file is structured as follows:

- Root Level: Each key at the root level represents a specific CVE ID.
  - CVE ID (e.g., `CVE-2018-10055`):
    - `description`: A detailed description of the vulnerability.
    - `base_score`: The base score assigned to the vulnerability (CVSS score).
    - `impact_score`: The impact score of the vulnerability.
    - `exploit_score`: The exploitability score of the vulnerability.
    - `pre_condition`: Conditions required before the vulnerability can be exploited.
    - `post_condition`: Effects or state after the vulnerability has been exploited.
    - `entities`: Contains detailed entities related to the vulnerability.
        - `Vulnerabilty_Type`: The type of vulnerability.
        - `Attack_Vector`: The method or vector through which the attack is executed.
        - `Impact`: The impact of the vulnerability.
        - `Affected_Product`: The product affected by the vulnerability.
        - `Root_Cause`: The root cause of the vulnerability.
        - `Attacker_Type`: The type of attacker exploiting the vulnerability.
    - `vertex_matching`: Contains a list of other CVEs with similarity scores.
    - `device`: The device or technology affected by the vulnerability.
    - `layer`: The computational layer (e.g., machine learning) where the vulnerability exists.
    - `target`: The specific target within the system affected by the vulnerability.
